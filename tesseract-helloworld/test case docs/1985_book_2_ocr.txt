At this stage your puppy requires regular food and
plenty of sleep; this is the secret of healthy growth. This
can be impeded if the puppy is troubled by round
worms. Your local veterinary surgeon will prescribe
tablets and tell you at what age they should be given. In
addition, at from eight to twelve weeks old, it will be
necessary to have the puppy vaccinated. The vet will
usually recommend a vaccine which will give
immunisation against Distemper, Infectious Hepatitis
and Leptospirosis and he will administer the vaccine by
injection, in two doses with a fortnight’s interval
between the doses. For ten days to a fortnight after its
vaccination, your puppy should be kept away from other
dogs — preferably at home. ‘Booster’ vaccinations are
needed from time to time, and your vet will tell you

/ When they should be given. These vaccinations are vitally
important if your dog is to remain fit and healthy.
