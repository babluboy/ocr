feet, and in less than no time the Giant
wife had popped Jack into the great oy
to hide. q

The Giant walked in sniffing the ai;
“TI smell boy,” he thundered.

“You are dreaming, laughed his wife
“but there is something better than
dreams in this dish.” So the Giant stopped
snifing and sat down to supper.

Through a hole in the oven Jack
peeped out and watched the Giant eat.
And how he did gobble! It seemed to
Jack that no one, not even a Giant, could
possibly eat so much. When all the dishes
were empty, the Giant bade his wite:
“Bring me my hen.”

She brought a much-ruffled hen and
put it on the table.

“Lay,” shouted the Giant, and the hen
laid a golden egg.
