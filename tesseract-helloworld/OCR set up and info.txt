python set up on ubuntu:
=======================
python and pip should be installed, then run the following pip commands:
pip install pillow
pip install pytesseract

Got lots of errors at this point on running python script. Required, tessaract libraries:
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt install libtesseract-dev

Was able to run the python script at this point.
run python code with absolute image path (relative path gives error - error handling required 
python ocr.py --image "/home/sid/Documents/Projects/OCR/tesseract-helloworld/example_01.png"


git set up and push
=======================
git push https://github.com/babluboy/nutty master
